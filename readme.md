Computation Design Machine

This project is exploring using Haxe as a way to output generative art code to multiple devices, including arduino (in this case a MicroView), native mac, native windows, and html5.

To Do:
[ ] Create offsets for where the content is rendered
[ ] Create side panel for description
[ ] Move pixel code to draw bitmaps instead of rectangles
